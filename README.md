## Build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

I ran out of time, I have only did a few minor unit tests. I intend to contine creating tests for the practice.

## Running end-to-end tests
I have not implemented the e2e test cases

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
